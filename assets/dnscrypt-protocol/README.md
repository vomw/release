# DNSCrypt Protocol Specification

This repository contains the formal specification of the [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info) protocol, a protocol for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver.

The DNSCrypt protocol aims to prevent DNS spoofing and other types of attacks by encrypting and authenticating DNS queries and responses.

The Anonymized DNSCrypt extension prevents DNS servers from associating queries with client IP addresses.
